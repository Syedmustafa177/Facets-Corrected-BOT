# Facets-Corrected-BOT
Python Based Facets BOT (Not an Open Source Code)


I've developed Python-based bots tailored for the Facets Application, although they are not open source. Please don't hesitate to contact me for more information.

1. **Corrected Claim Auto Keyer Bot**: This bot efficiently integrates modifications from corrected images into the original Facets claim.

2. **Cob Auto Keyer**: A Python-based automation tool that seamlessly incorporates EOB (Explanation of Benefits) data from Macess Images into Facets.

3. **End-to-End COB Auto Adjudicator**: This bot provides comprehensive automation for the processing of Coordination of Benefits (COB) claims within Facets.

4. **Data Elements Checker Bot**: An automated solution for meticulously verifying data elements.

5. **Segregation Bot**: This bot determines the claim type (EDI, paper, COB, Authorization, or Corrected) through a systematic segregation process. If you have any further questions or need additional details, please feel free to reach out.
